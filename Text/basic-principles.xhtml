<h2>Basic Principles of Algorithmic Rationalism</h2>

<p class = "head">
Only one thing is sacrosanct in <a href = "glossary.xhtml#df_algorithmic_rationalism"
class = "glsr">Algorithmic Rationalism</a>,
and that is the conviction that
people ought to follow the dictates of
logic, reason, and evidence wherever they lead.
Consequently, there is only one thing that is taboo
in Algorithmic Rationalism, and that taboo is to
go against the one sacrosanct.
</p>

<p class = "reg">
As for the methodologies used in Algorithmic Rationalism,
the imperative to follow them is not a separate thing
from the one sacrosanct, but an extension of it.
This is because you are not truly following the dictates
of logic, reason, and evidence wherever they lead if
you violate the process by which these dictates are
followed.

<p class = "reg">
While the development and further refinement of the art
of Algorithmic Rationalism may end up being a specialized
field or even a set of specialized fields,
the everyday application of Algorithmic Rationalism must
never be - and those who develop and refine the art
must retain that as a crucial design goal.
This is because a truly enlgihtened society can
not exist if only an elite few are trained to think
rationally.
Not everyone may be able to develop their faculty of
reason to the same level - but a certain minimal level
of rational training ought to be a standard part of
everybody's education.
