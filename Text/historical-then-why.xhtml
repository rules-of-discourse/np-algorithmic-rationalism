<h3>Why Then Algorithmic Rationalism</h3>

<p class = "head">
It is for this reason that Algorithmic Rationalism is being developed
for the purpose of allowing rationality to rise above the noise.
It's goal is to provide a means by which to as objectively tell
honest discussion
apart from irrational rhetoric without having to rely on
any foregone conclusions of what is or isn't true.
</p>

<p class = "reg">
It is hoped that it may be possible for the skills that
would be developed
under the guideance of this philosophy to be spread to society
at-large, and that therefore a more rational, sane, and just
world may come as a result.
