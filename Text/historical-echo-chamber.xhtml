<h3>The Echo Chambers</h3>

<p class = "head">
In an environment in which the overwhelming majority of people
have such disregard for objective reality, there is often
no standard by which to resolve disagreements.
Therefore, discussion on matters
in which either side or both sides have high stakes or strong
emotional vesture tend to devolve into blatant hostility.
This hostility often escalates to the point that lines of communications
between people who disagree are ruptured, forming enclaves of people
whose commonality is defined by their agreement on certain issues.
These enclaves are referred to commonly as "echo chambers".

<p class = "reg">
In this environment, very few people still care for reason and
evidence and sound discourse that values these things.
A few people, however, do have regard for objective reality
and do indeed care about these tools for investigating it.
However, those people, too, tend to be trapped in echo chambers.
These people wish to have rational dialogue on important subjects,
but lack any partner with which to have such rational dialogue.
Even though potential such partners exist, connecting with them can be
difficult.
Such Rationalists may attempt to hold open the channels of communication
through which to communicate with fellow Rationalists of differeng
sociopolitical persuasion - but run the risk of their good will being
taken advantage by non-Rationalists who fail to discern the distinction
between an invitation to rational dialogue versus an invitaion to
launch an assault of rationally-empty rhetoric.
